    "- **Context and Company Background:** TechWorks Consulting, a company specializing in IT talent recruitment, and highlights its unique approach to matching skilled IT professionals with job opportunities.\n",
    "- **Data Description:** The Dataset conatins information about colleges, cities, roles, previous experience, and salary. This information will be used to train and test the predictive model.\n",
    "- **Regression Task:** The primary objective is to perform a regression task, where the aim is to predict a continuous variable, specifically the salary of newly hired employees.\n",
    "- **Role of Statistics:** The role of statistics is to build and check the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing:** Data Preprocessing is most important task as it involves tasks like handling missing values, outliers, categorical variables, normalization, and feature selection."

    "- **Data Understanding:**\n",
    "  - Begin by thoroughly understanding the provided dataset, including its structure, columns, and the meaning of each variable. Gain insights into the data's distribution, summary statistics, and potential outliers.\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "  - Handle Missing Values: Identify and address missing data by imputation or removal, ensuring that data is complete.\n",
    "  - Outlier Detection and Treatment: Detect and handle outliers in the dataset, which could impact the model's accuracy.\n",
    "  - Convert Categorical Data: Transform categorical variables (e.g., \"College\" and \"City\") into numerical format.\n",
    "  - Normalize Data: Normalize numerical features to bring them to a common scale to avoid any feature dominating the model.\n",
    "  - Feature Selection: Use statistical techniques such as Lasso, Ridge, or correlation analysis to select the most relevant features for salary prediction.\n",
    "- **Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "- **Model Selection:**\n",
    "    - Choose different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Multi Linear Regression) to build and evaluate the predictive models.\n",
    "- **Model Training and Evaluation:**\n",
    "    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the models and assess their performance.\n",
    "    - Use appropriate evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure the model's accuracy.\n",
    "    - Experiment with different hyperparameters for each model and use cross-validation to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "- **Model Comparison:**\n",
    "    - Compare the performance of different models and select the one with the best accuracy and generalization.\n",
    "- **Further Improvement:**\n",
    "    - Consider additional techniques for model improvement, such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods."

    "# The available ML model options had to perform on this task\n",
    "#### In the task of predicting employee salary at TechWorks Consulting, there are several machine learning model options available for regression tasks. The choice of the model depends on various factors, including the nature of the data, the complexity of the problem, and the need for model interpretability. Here are some of the available ML model options:\n",
    "**1. Linear Regression:**\n",
    "- Linear regression is a simple and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable (salary). It's a good starting point and can provide baseline performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression:**\n",
    "- Ridge and Lasso regression are regularization techniques that can be used to handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting. They are variants of linear regression that add regularization terms to the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Decision Trees:**\n",
    "- Decision tree-based models, like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, are capable of capturing non-linear relationships in the data. They can handle both numerical and categorical features and automatically deal with feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**\n",
    "- KNN is a non-parametric method that makes predictions based on the average of the 'k' nearest data points. It can be effective for small to medium-sized datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Polynomial Regression:**\n",
    "- Polynomial regression can be used to capture non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these 5 models, I will be performing only 3 of them with default parameters and with somes doing changes in parameter"

    "To compare the performance of different machine learning models, we'll focus on the R-squared (r2_score) metric, which measures the goodness of fit of the models. A higher R-squared indicates a better fit to the data. Additionally, we'll consider Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for reference.\n",

    "**Summary:**\n",
    "- Among the different models, Random Forest consistently performs well in all scenarios with or without feature scaling, and with varying test sizes. It achieves the highest R-squared scores, indicating a good fit to the data.\n",
    "- Linear Regression and Lasso also perform well but with slightly lower R-squared scores compared to Random Forest.\n",
    "- Decision Tree, on the other hand, has the lowest R-squared scores and performs the worst among the models in all scenarios.\n",
    "- Feature scaling appears to have a positive impact on model performance, as evidenced by the higher R-squared scores in scenarios with feature scaling compared to those without.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, if we consider R-squared as the primary metric for model performance, Random Forest is the top performer, followed by Linear Regression and Lasso. It's essential to consider other factors like computational efficiency, model interpretability, and the specific goals of your application when choosing the best model."
