# ðŸ§  FINAL PROJECT - Regression Model

This project applies machine learning regression techniques  redefine salary determination for new hires at TechWorks Consulting. Consideration of factors like education, experience, role, previous compensation, and academic records ensures fair and competitive salary predictions. The dataset is analyzed, preprocessed, and used to train a model for predictions.

## ðŸ“Š Results

ðŸ”¹ **Model Used**: Linear Regression,Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression:,Decision tree,KNN,polynominal regression

we have performed with different test sizes and also with scaling and without scaling.
we acquired different r2_score ,all the result set is attached below.
  among all Linear Regression performs well with or without scaling.
